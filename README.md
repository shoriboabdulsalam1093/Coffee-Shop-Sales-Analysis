<h1>Coffee Shop Sales Analysis (Interactive Dashboard Using Ms Excel)</h1>

<h2>Project Objective</h2>
The Coffee shop wants to analyse its sales data of three years (2019, 2020, 2021) to get insight on how to improve their sales strategies in the coming years.
<br />

<h2>Description</h2>
This project involves the creation of an interactive dashboard to visualize coffee sales data for a coffee shop. The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of sales trends, geographic performance, customer behavior, and product preferences, enabling data-driven decision-making. Built with a user-friendly interface, the dashboard allows stakeholders to filter and explore the data dynamically, revealing key insights for improving sales strategies and customer engagement.

- What is the most preferred package weight? <br />
- What is the impact of loyalty card on sales? <br />
- What sales volumes are associated with specific combinations of roast types and sizes? <br />
